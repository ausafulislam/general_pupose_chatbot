## üöÄ Installation

Follow these steps to get your General Purpose Chatbot up and running.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system.

### Step-by-Step Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    Start by cloning the project repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ausafulislam/general_pupose_chatbot.git
    cd general_pupose_chatbot
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment**
    It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment**

    - **On Windows:**
      ```bash
      .venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - **On macOS/Linux:**
      ```bash
      source .venv/bin/activate
      ```

4.  **Install Dependencies**
    Install all required Python packages using `pip`:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    # If using uv, you can also use:
    # uv sync
    ```

    _Note: A `requirements.txt` file is implied by `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`. If `requirements.txt` doesn't exist, generate it from `pyproject.toml` or install directly from `pyproject.toml` using `pip install .` or `uv pip install .`._

5.  **Environment Configuration**
    The project uses environment variables for sensitive information like API keys.

    - Rename `.env.example` to `.env`:
      ```bash
      mv .env.example .env
      ```
    - Open the newly created `.env` file and add your Gemini API key:
      ```
      GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE
      ```
      Replace `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key obtained from Google AI Studio.

## üí° Usage

Once installed and configured, you can run the chatbot from your terminal.

### Running the Chatbot

To start an interactive session with the chatbot, execute the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
```

You can then start typing your queries directly into the terminal. The chatbot will process your input and provide a response.

### Common Use Cases

- **Information Retrieval:** Ask about facts, definitions, historical events, etc.
- **Problem Solving:** Get suggestions or explanations for coding problems, general knowledge questions.
- **Learning & Education:** Inquire about various topics to deepen your understanding.
- **Creative Ideas:** Brainstorm ideas or get creative writing prompts.
